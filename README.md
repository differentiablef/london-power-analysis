# Analysis of London Energy Usage

## Proposal
The phenomenon of TV Pickup is a UK Term used to express the spike in electrical energy consumption that occurs when a break takes place in a TV programme that has attracted a large audience. It is typically caused by people boiling kettles for tea and the opening of fridge doors. The phenomenon has been observed for both sporting events as well as popular soap operas. To test the validity of the phenomenon of TV Pickup the following will be analyzed:

* Household Energy Usage During 2013 and 2012 ( https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households )

* The top 20 sporting events in the United Kingdom based on TV ratings. ( www.barb.co.uk )
    
and compared to try and observe instances of TV Pickup.
